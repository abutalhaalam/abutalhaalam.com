        <h1>Library</h1>
        <p>A little page on what I have been reading and my reviews (if they were recent and I remember it enough). Although I call it a Library. It is more of a bookshelf. A little place where you can find inspirations to read many different things from
            a variety of topics. Even if it isn't a library now, I hope that one day I can turn it into one.
        </p>

        <p>I have given a rating and a short sentence description of each book. My personal favourites are highlighted in red. Click onto the book for a more detailed review and choose should you read or not.</p>
