        <h1>[Uncomplete]Some Philosophies that I align myself with</h1>
        <h2>Kaizen</h2>
        <h2>Absurdism</h2>
        <h2>Stoicism</h2>
        <h3>While these philosophies seem distinct and different from each other, they share a common ground that align with my core ambitions: the desire to cultivate resilience, adaptability, and personal growth. </h3>
        <p> Let's start off by sauing that the best people I have talked to at parties are those who are into stoicism. <br>Stoicism generally puts an emphasis on accepting the present moment, inner peace and virtue. It promotes the idea that a person can
            attain peace and wisdom through the practice of virtue and the acceptance of whatever hurdle that appears and acting within their own control. Its all about cultivatig a sense of detachment from external circumstances and instead focussing
            internally on deveoloping an inner resilliance that helps navigate the ups and downs of life.I find that it encourages individuality and self respect. You shouldnt allow yourslef to be put down just because you are aware of a negative outcome
            and you do not wish to face it. It teaches you to differentiate between what is within your power and what isn't.It enocurages you to direct your attention and efforts to something that that you cant control; Things like your thoughts, attitude
            and actions. By embracing the absolute fact that external events are only temporary and will fade away in time and embracing that change is inevitable in our lives, stoicism gives individuals the ability to find joy and happiness in the present
            moment.
