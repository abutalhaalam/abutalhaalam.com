        <h1>day 1.</h1>
        <h2><i>"being the light: true strength, no harm, love and let go"</i></h2>
        <p><i>an extract taken out of my journal</i></p>
        <p>the assumption is out there that if someone is out their pushing their mind, chasing their growth like most people couldn't even imagine, surely they must've gone there with some kind of quick fix, some kind of short cut.<br><br> most people can't
            fathom that someone is out there obeying their alarm clock relentlessly, someone is out their surrendering their comfort to that cold shower every single morning, someone is out there at 2am in the morning grinding their heart out, someone
            is out there breathing short and heavy while others are barely trying to breathe at all, someone is out there putting in the work that no one wants to believe is true because that someone wants to be something more.<br><br> to be in the 1%
            you have to do the things that the 99% wont.<br> risking is better than regretting.<br>life is a one time offer so use it well. <br><i>only dead fish go with the flow.</i> <br>there is no success without sacrifice.<br> mindset is what seperates
            the best from the rest.<br> everything you have ever wanted is on the other side of fear and doubt and anxiety.<br><br><br> remove those in your life that don't support you, that envy you, that gets jealous if you.<br> surround yourself with
            people that will help you grow, people that you will help grow,<br> people that would hype you up and help you no matter what.<br> think about those people that you call friends.think about how they behave or react after you get an achievment
            or do something good with your life or if you try to change.<br>do they say stuff like "oh thank god we have the old you back" or maybe even "you got lucky" or whatever. can these people be called actual real friends?<br>re-evaluate your choices
            in life, observe and then act.<br><br>outwork or be outworked<br>burn the boat.<br>this is the philosohpy that i live by. If you dont do it, someone else will do it. cease the oppurtunity. cease the chance.<br><br>never look back, look ahead
            and move confidently in the direction of your dreams and everything else will follow.<br> love yourself and love others, <br>hold no enmity, <br>hold no regrets,<br> and hold no anger.<br> holding onto anger and hatred is like drinking poison
            yourself and expecting the other to die.<br> remove the thought entirely from your head. <br><br>be kind to others.<br> be kind to yourself.<br> forgive but do not forget.<br> expect nothing from others and appreciate everything you have and
            everything you get.<br> call your mom and tell her that you love her. call your dad and tell him how grateful you are to him. call your siblings and parents and tell them how much you love them. <br><br>live life without regrets.<br> let go
            of all your previous burdens and live life in a way where you get no more. <br>find your purpose please. <br>life without a goal is not a life. <br>keep dreaming.<br><br> it is not a disgrace to die before reaching the stars but it is a disgrace
            to die not trying.<br> strive to be the person you needed the most when you were suffering.<br> remind yourself who you want to be; a flame, a star, a light.
            <br> do for the world what it has not done for you.<br> true strength is when you take the knife that has stabbed your from your back and hold onto it without inflicting it onto others.<br> the best revenge is not to be like those that hurt
            you.
            <br> one day soon you'll look back and realise all you have gained is far greater than what you have lost.<br><br> love others and love yourself. <br><br>go confidently in the direction of your dreams<br> goodnight, stay safe and see you tomorrow
